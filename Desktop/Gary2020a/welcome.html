                    <i>"Thank you for to all of our faithful customers over the years. We appreciate your business. <br>If you
                    are in need of a horse shoer or foot corrections made, I am your guy."</i>
                    <h4>Gary Coats</h4>
                    <strong>Horseshoer and roper Gary Coats and
                    his wife Sharon, own and operate Coats Horseshoeing<br>in San Angelo, Texas. Gary has
                    been shoeing since 1981 and is well known
                    all over<br>West Texas for his shoeing expertise.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Born and raised in Nebraska, Gary traveled to
                    Arizona late in 1980 to learn his trade at<br>Dale's
                    Western Horseshoeing School in Phoenix where
                    he completed the three-month course.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After receiving his diploma, they went back
                    to Nebraska where Gary helped is brother,<br>
                    Bill Coats Jr., shoe horses. They also ran
                    Thoroughbreds and Quarterhorses on the track<br>
                    where they stayed for eight years before
                    heading to San Angelo to begin shoeing. Gary's<br>
                    business exploded and he quickly became a top
                    shoer. Gary specializes in corrective shoeing<br>and is
                    the best at taking a horse with hoof problems
                    and making him sound again. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Life has thrown a few punches at Gary over the
                    years, but he has never been away from<br>
                    shoeing more than a week at a time. Gary has never
                    stopped in his 40+ years and he<br>
                    won't stop now unless the Lord decides differently.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Coats Shoeing is a family affair and they all pitch in and help when Gary needs it. Son-in-law<br>Andy Lumpkin
                    lives close by and helps Gary daily with the trimming and shoeing. Another<br> son-in-law, Caleb Felts is able to
                    help when he can and Kipp Harrell pitches in from time to<br>time as well.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Along with his wife of 42 years, Gary and Sharon have three daughters.  Kasey is married<br>to Andy and they have one son, Levi,
                    who is known to strap on his shoeing chaps and help<br>
                    Pappy out with the rasping. Daughter Kelly teaches school and works part time as a vet tech<br>and 
                    Kirby is married to Caleb and they have a boy and girl, Eli and Piper; who also help<br>Pappy in the barn.
